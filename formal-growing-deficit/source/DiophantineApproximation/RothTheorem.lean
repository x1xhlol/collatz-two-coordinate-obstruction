# Roth's theorem

**Roth's theorem** (Bombieri–Gubler, Theorem 6.4.1; Roth 1955 over `ℚ` at one place, Ridout 1958
over `ℚ` at several, Lang over a number field). Let `K` be a number field, `S` a finite set of
places of `K` carried as two typed finsets, `F / K` a finite extension, `w v` an absolute value of
`F` over `v` and `α v ∈ F` a target for each `v ∈ S`. Then for every `κ > 2` the set of `β ∈ K`
with

```text
(∏ v ∈ S∞, min 1 |β − α v|_v ^ mult v) * ∏ v ∈ S₀, min 1 |β − α v|_v  ≤  H(β) ^ (−κ)
```

is finite. Heights are Mathlib's relative ones, so this is the book's statement raised to the
power `[K : ℚ]`; every quantity in it is homogeneous of the same degree and the inequality reads
the same in either normalisation.

The proof is the book's, in five steps, and the file is only their assembly:

* **Step 0** (`DiophantineApproximation/RothClass.lean`, on Layer 3.1): discard the finitely many
  `β` of height `1` and the at most `|S|` that equal a target, classify the rest by Mahler's
  reduction, and take an `(L, M)`-independent sequence inside one class. What comes out is a
  vector of exponents `λ` with `∑ a, λ a ≥ 1 − |S| / N` such that every member of the sequence
  satisfies `min 1 |β − α_a|_a ^ w_a ≤ H(β) ^ (−κ λ a)`.
* **Steps I and II** (`DiophantineApproximation/RothAuxiliary.lean`, on Layers 2.6 and 2.7): build
  the auxiliary polynomial at the multidegree `d j = ⌈D / h(β j)⌉` and differentiate it until it
  survives at `β`.
* **Steps III to V** (`DiophantineApproximation/RothKeyInequality.lean`, on Layers 2.1 and 0.3):
  bound the value at every place, multiply by the product formula, and compare.

The parameters are chosen in the book's order — `ε` and `N` from `κ`, then the number of variables
`m + 1` from the feasibility of the index theorem, then `L` and `M`, then the solutions, and only
then `D`. Everything chosen before `L` is a definition depending on `κ`, `|S|` and `[F : K]`
alone, and Steps I to V are proved as a statement about a chain already in hand, in which every
member carries its own targets, `NumberField.roth_no_moving_chain`: no chain of `m + 1` solutions
in one approximation class, with heights growing by the ratio `M`, has targets small against it.
Its constant case is `NumberField.roth_no_chain` — above a height `L` there is no
`(L, M)`-independent chain of solutions in one class — and Roth's theorem is that statement fed
by Step 0.

## Main definitions

* `NumberField.rothEps`, `NumberField.rothClassSize`, `NumberField.rothChainLength` and
  `NumberField.rothRatio`: the `ε`, the `N`, the `m` and the `M` of the proof.

## Main results

* `NumberField.finite_setOf_prod_min_one_le`: **Layer 3.2**, Roth's theorem.
* `NumberField.roth_no_moving_chain`: **the core of the proof, with moving targets** — no chain
  of `rothChainLength κ |S| [F : K] + 1` solutions in one class, each with its own targets, has
  `1 + ∑ v, h(α j v) ≤ δ h(β j)` throughout — which is what Layer 3.8 consumes.
* `NumberField.roth_no_chain`: its constant case — no chain above a height `L` — which is what
  Layer 3.7 counts with.
* `NumberField.max_apply_one_le_mulHeight₁_sPlaceAbsValue`: the size of a target at a place of
  `S` is at most its height.
* `Real.exists_le_and_mul_log_add_lt`: the elementary fact that replaces the book's `D → ∞`.

## Implementation notes

⚠ **Nothing tends to infinity.** The book lets `D → ∞` and reads off `(6.22)`; here every error
term is explicit, the only one that is not `O(D / L)` is `([K : ℚ] + 2 ∑ a, w_a) log (D + 2)`, and
one `D` large enough is produced by hand. That is also why no filter, no `IsLittleO` and no
`Tendsto` appears anywhere in Layer 3.2.

⚠ **The two degenerate families of solutions are discarded by Northcott and by injectivity.** A
`β` of height at most `1` has no logarithmic profile, and a `β` equal to a target at some place has
local factor `0` there; the first set is finite by Northcott, the second has at most one element
per place, and an infinite solution set stays infinite after both are removed. This is the book's
"non-trivial approximation".

⚠ **`κ > 2` enters exactly once**, through `1 / κ < 1 / 2`: it is what leaves room for the two
losses `4 ε` and `|S| / N`, and the contradiction is `κ (1 − |S| / N) (1/2 − 4 ε) > 1`. No other
step uses the value of `κ`.

⚠ **The proof was restructured for Layer 3.7, and the theorem did not change.** Layer 3.2 first
proved Roth's theorem as one proof by contradiction, with `ε`, `N` and `m` obtained from
existentials inside it. Counting solutions needs the chain statement with its parameters in view,
so the parameters became definitions and the steps after Step 0 became
`NumberField.roth_no_chain`; the statement of `NumberField.finite_setOf_prod_min_one_le` is
unchanged. From outside, the targets enter only through `L`: the length `m`, the ratio `M` and
the class size `N` do not see them.

⚠ **It was restructured again for Layer 3.8, and none of this file's public statements changed.**
The core now takes a chain whose members have their own targets: Steps I and II put the index at the
point `(α 0 v, …, α m v)`, Steps III to V take one target and one size bound per coordinate, and the
condition on the targets is `1 + ∑ v, h(α j v) ≤ δ h(β j)` with `δ` independent of them; the
statements of those steps were generalized, and nothing outside Layer 3.2 quotes them. That needs
the size `|α j v|_v` bounded by the height, which the fixed-target proof could leave as a constant:
`NumberField.max_apply_one_le_mulHeight₁_sPlaceAbsValue`, from Layer 0.1's classification.
`NumberField.roth_no_chain` is then the constant case, with `L = [K : ℚ] (1 + ∑ v, h(α v)) / δ`.

/-! ### The parameters

Everything the proof chooses before it sees a solution, as functions of `κ`, of the number `s`
of places and of `r = [F : K]`. The choices are the book's up to constants, and nothing here
depends on `K` or on the targets: that is what lets Layer 3.7 count solutions with a bound that
does not either.

of the index theorem. -/

/-- **The core of Roth's proof, with moving targets** (Bombieri–Gubler 6.4.5 to 6.4.10, as 6.5.2
reads them): there is a `δ > 0` such that **no chain of `rothChainLength κ s r + 1` solutions in
one approximation class, with heights growing by the ratio `rothRatio κ s r`, has targets small
against it** — `1 + ∑ v ∈ S, h(α j v) ≤ δ h(β j)` for every member `β j`, whose own targets are
`α j`. Here `s = |S|`, `r = [F : K]`, and the class is given by its vector of exponents `λ`, with
`∑ λ ≥ 1 − s / N` for `N = rothClassSize κ s`. The number `δ` depends on `K`, `S`, `[F : ℚ]` and
`κ` and on no target; the smallness condition is in absolute heights and the ratio, which reads
the same in both normalizations, in Mathlib's relative ones. -/

/-- **The core of Roth's proof** (Bombieri–Gubler 6.4.5 to 6.4.10, read as in 6.5.7): there is a
height `L` — depending on `K`, `S` and the targets — such that **no `(L, M)`-independent chain of
`rothChainLength κ s r + 1` solutions lies in one approximation class**. Here `s = |S|`,
`r = [F : K]`, `M = rothRatio κ s r` and the class is given by its vector of exponents `λ`, with
`∑ λ ≥ 1 − s / N` for `N = rothClassSize κ s`; the length, the ratio and the class size depend on
`κ`, `s` and `r` alone. Heights are Mathlib's relative ones. It is the fixed-target case of
`NumberField.roth_no_moving_chain`, with `L = [K : ℚ] (1 + ∑ v ∈ S, h(α v)) / δ`. -/
