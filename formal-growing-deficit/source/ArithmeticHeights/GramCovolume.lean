# The covolume of a lattice as a Gram determinant

For a `ℤ`-lattice `L` in a finite-dimensional real inner product space, the covolume of `L` — the
volume of a fundamental domain for the canonical measure, the one giving the parallelepiped of an
orthonormal basis volume `1` — is the square root of the Gram determinant `det ⟪b i, b j⟫` of any
`ℤ`-basis `b` of `L`.

This is the form in which a covolume is computed in the geometry of numbers whenever the lattice
is presented by generators rather than by a fundamental domain, and it is the step that turns the
covolume of a lattice of rational points into a sum of squares of maximal minors: composed with the
Cauchy–Binet identity it says that the squared covolume of the lattice spanned by the rows of a
matrix is the sum of the squares of its maximal minors.

Mathlib has `ZLattice.covolume_eq_det`, the corresponding statement in `ι → ℝ` with the Lebesgue
measure, where the answer is the determinant of the basis matrix; in an inner product space there
is no ambient basis to take a determinant against, and the Gram matrix is what replaces it.

## Main results

* `ZLattice.covolume_eq_abs_det_orthonormalBasis`: the covolume is the absolute determinant of the
  coordinate matrix of a `ℤ`-basis in any orthonormal basis of the ambient space.
* `ZLattice.covolume_sq_eq_det_gram`: the squared covolume is the Gram determinant of any
  `ℤ`-basis.
* `ZLattice.covolume_eq_sqrt_det_gram`: the covolume is the square root of that determinant.

## Implementation notes

Mathlib's naming convention in `Mathlib/Algebra/Module/ZLattice/Covolume.lean` is that a result
about `ι → ℝ` carries the plain name and its `InnerProductSpace` counterpart carries a prime. The
three results here are not primed counterparts of anything: `covolume_eq_det` has no Gram matrix
in it, and the Gram determinant is not available in `ι → ℝ` without choosing an inner product.

The index type of the `ℤ`-basis is arbitrary; the orthonormal basis of the ambient space is
obtained from `stdOrthonormalBasis` by reindexing along the equivalence that
`ZLattice.rank`— through `Basis.ofZLatticeBasis` — provides, so no hypothesis relating the index
type to `Module.finrank` is needed.

## References

J. W. S. Cassels, *An Introduction to the Geometry of Numbers*, Springer (1959), Chapter III, §5,
where the covolume of a lattice given by a basis matrix `A` is `|det A|`, and the Gram form
`√(det (A Aᵀ))` is the one used when the lattice sits in a subspace of larger dimension.

This is Layer 4.3 of the `ArithmeticHeights` roadmap, the infrastructure half: the covolume
identity of that milestone is proved by computing both sides of it against a Gram determinant.

sitting in a subspace `W` of `F` is the image under `f` of an `ℝ`-basis `b`, then its squared
covolume is `det A` times the Gram determinant of `b`, for any `A` with `⟪f x, f y⟫ = ⟪A x, y⟫`.
This is the form in which the archimedean half of a covolume identity is computed: the lattice is
transported from a space where its covolume is known, and the transport factor is an operator
