# Minkowski's second theorem

For a lattice `L` in a finite-dimensional real normed space `E` of dimension `n` and a symmetric
convex body `B`, Minkowski's second theorem is the pair of inequalities

```text
2 ^ n / n !  *  covolume L  ≤  (∏ i < n, λ i) * volume B  ≤  2 ^ n * covolume L,
```

with `λ i` the successive minima of Layer 4.1. This file proves both, and the two pieces of
Cassels' route that are statements in their own right.

## Main results

* `ZLattice.covolume_le_prod_successiveMinimum_mul_measure`: the lower bound. The independent
  lattice vectors realizing the minima, divided by their minima, span a cross-polytope inside `B`
  of volume `2 ^ n / n !` times the covolume of the lattice they generate, divided by `∏ i, λ i`;
  and that covolume is a positive integer multiple of the covolume of `L`.
* `ZLattice.prod_successiveMinimum_mul_measure_le`: the upper bound, the substantial half — the
  direction Layer 5 and 6.3 consume. Weyl's proof, through Cassels' Theorem IV, which is
  `ZLattice.pow_mul_measure_inter_add_le` of `ArithmeticHeights/QuotientFubini.lean`: the measure
  of the image of the open dilate `{gauge B < t}` in `E ⧸ L` is scaled up one minimum at a time,
  from `t = λ 0 / 2` — where the dilate injects into the quotient — to `t = λ (n - 1) / 2`, where
  it is bounded by the covolume.
* `ZLattice.pow_successiveMinimum_zero_mul_measure_le`: `λ 0 ^ n * volume B ≤ 2 ^ n * covolume L`,
  which is Minkowski's first theorem read homogeneously. It is the upper bound with `∏ i < n, λ i`
  weakened to `λ 0 ^ n`, and it is everything the first theorem gives.
* `ZLattice.exists_basis_mem_span_int_of_gauge_lt`: Cassels' Chapter VIII, Lemma 2 — a `ℤ`-basis
  of `L` against which every lattice point of gauge below the `j`-th minimum is an *integer*
  combination of the first `j` members. Layer 4.6 consumes it; the upper bound below does not.

## Implementation notes

⚠ **The reduction that would make the upper bound easy is false.** The worked example at the end
of this file machine-checks that shrinking one coordinate of a symmetric convex body can leave the
body. The linear map sending the realizing vector `v i` to `(λ i / λ (n - 1)) • v i` has
determinant `∏ λ i / λ (n - 1) ^ n` and nondecreasing coordinate factors in `(0, 1]`, which is
exactly the shape that example refutes: such a map need not send the body into itself, so the
upper bound is not the statement that some one set is a packing, and no rescaling of the body
makes it one. Weyl's proof replaces the set inclusion by a measure estimate in the quotient
`E ⧸ L`, and is a genuinely different argument.

⚠ **Neither inequality needs the body closed, bounded away from nothing, or compact.** The lower
bound uses the vectors through `gauge B (v i) = λ i` and meets the body through
`mem_smul_of_gauge_lt`, the half of the gauge dictionary that holds for any body. The upper bound
is chained on the *open* dilates `{gauge B < t}`, which is what lets the separation hypothesis of
Cassels' Theorem IV hold at `2 t = λ J` rather than only below it; the body and its interior have
the same measure because a convex set has null frontier. Only
`ZLattice.pow_successiveMinimum_zero_mul_measure_le` carries `IsCompact B`, and only because
Mathlib's form of Minkowski's first theorem does.

⚠ **Cassels' Lemma 2 is not on the path to the upper bound.** He needs the adapted basis because
he works in coordinates, where the integrality of the first `J` coordinates is how one sees that
the translation stays inside the sublattice. Coordinate-free the sublattice
`L ∩ span (v 0, …, v (J - 1))` is at hand, and the only thing the estimate wants of it is its
`ℤ`-rank, which is the `ℝ`-dimension of its span by `ZLattice.finrank_int_eq_finrank_real`. The
lemma stays in this file because Layer 4.6 does want the basis.

/-! ### Cassels' Lemma 2: a basis adapted to the minima -/

omit [MeasurableSpace E] [BorelSpace E] in
/-- **Cassels' Chapter VIII, Lemma 2.** Some `ℤ`-basis `b` of `L` has, for every `j`, every lattice
point of gauge below the `j`-th minimum an *integer* combination of `b 0, …, b (j - 1)`.

This is the first of the two pieces Weyl's proof of the upper bound needs, and it is exactly the
combination of two things proved elsewhere: the dependence half of Cassels' Lemma 1
(`ZLattice.mem_span_of_gauge_lt_successiveMinimum`, Layer 4.1), which puts such a point in the
`ℝ`-span of the first `j` vectors realizing the minima, and the adapted basis
(`ZLattice.exists_basis_mem_span_int_of_mem_span_real`), which makes the lattice points of that
span the *integer* combinations of the first `j` basis vectors. Cassels proves the second by his
Chapter I, Theorem I; neither half is in Mathlib.

⚠ The basis is not the family realizing the minima, and in general cannot be: Layer 4.6 is the
statement of how far apart the two can be. What survives is the flag. -/

/-! ### The upper bound

Weyl's argument, as Cassels carries it: the measure of the image of the open dilate
`{gauge B < t}` in `E ⧸ L` grows at least like `s ^ (n - J)` when `t` is scaled by `s ≥ 1` inside
the range where congruence modulo `L` is congruence modulo `L ∩ span (v 0, …, v (J - 1))`, and
chaining that from the first minimum to the last multiplies the measure of the body by the product
of the minima. The estimate itself is `ZLattice.pow_mul_measure_inter_add_le` of
`ArithmeticHeights/QuotientFubini.lean`; what is here is the chain and the gauge bookkeeping. -/

/-- **Minkowski's second theorem, the upper bound** (Cassels, Chapter VIII, Theorem V, the
inequality (12) of VIII.1): `(∏ i < n, λ i) * volume B ≤ 2 ^ n * covolume L`. This is the
substantial half, the one Layer 5 and 6.3 consume.

The proof is Weyl's, through Cassels' Theorem IV, which is
`ZLattice.pow_mul_measure_inter_add_le`. Write `S t` for the image of the open dilate
`{gauge B < t}` in `E ⧸ L`. At `t = λ 0 / 2` the dilate injects into the quotient, so
`m (S t) = t ^ n * volume B`; and for `1 ≤ J < n` and `s = λ J / λ (J - 1)` the estimate gives
`m (S (s t)) ≥ s ^ (n - J) * m (S t)` at `t = λ (J - 1) / 2`, because there congruence modulo `L`
inside the dilate is congruence modulo `L ∩ span (v 0, …, v (J - 1))`, a sublattice of `ℤ`-rank at
most `J`. Chaining and bounding `m (S (λ (n - 1) / 2))` by the covolume multiplies `volume B` by
the telescoping product `λ 0 ^ n * ∏_{J = 1}^{n - 1} (λ J / λ (J - 1)) ^ (n - J) = ∏ i < n, λ i`.

⚠ **The chain runs on open dilates, and that is what removes closedness.** For a closed body the
dilate contains points of gauge exactly `t`, and the separation hypothesis would hold only for
`2 t < λ J` strictly; for `{gauge B < t}` it holds at `2 t = λ J`, which is where the chain needs
it. The body and its interior have the same measure because a convex set has null frontier.

⚠ **Cassels' Lemma 2 is not used.** He needs the adapted basis because he works in coordinates:
the integrality of the first `J` coordinates is how he sees that the translation stays in the
sublattice. Coordinate-free the sublattice `L ∩ span (v 0, …, v (J - 1))` is at hand and the only
thing wanted of it is its rank, which is the `ℝ`-dimension of its span by
`ZLattice.finrank_int_eq_finrank_real`. -/

/-! ### Why the upper bound is not a packing statement

The upper bound of Minkowski's second theorem would follow at once from the following false
statement: for a symmetric convex body `B` and `0 < c ≤ 1`, shrinking one coordinate of a point
of `B` — in the basis realizing the minima, and shrinking the *earlier* coordinates, whose minima
are the smaller ones — keeps it inside `B`. It fails already in the plane. -/

section Examples

/-- ⚠ **Shrinking a coordinate can leave a symmetric convex body**, so the linear map whose
determinant is the product of the minima does not map the body into itself. The body here is the
thin parallelogram `|x| ≤ 1`, `|19 x - 20 y| ≤ 1` along the diagonal: it contains `(1, 19/20)`,
but not `(9/10, 19/20)`, which the segment to `(0, 19/20)` has already left. -/
