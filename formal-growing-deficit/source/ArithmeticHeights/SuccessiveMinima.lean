# The successive minima of a symmetric convex body

For a lattice `L` in a finite-dimensional real normed space `E` and a symmetric convex body `B`,
the `i`-th successive minimum is the least dilation of `B` that contains `i + 1` linearly
independent points of `L`. This file defines it, proves it positive, monotone and homogeneous of
degree `-1` in the body, and proves Cassels' Lemma 1: the minima are attained, by one family of
independent lattice vectors realizing all of them at once.

## Main definitions

* `ZLattice.successiveMinimum`: the `i`-th successive minimum, as the infimum of the admissible
  dilations. For `i ≥ finrank ℝ E` there are none and the value is `sInf ∅ = 0`, so every
  statement below carries `i < finrank ℝ E`.

## Main results

* `gauge_le_iff_mem_smul`: the dictionary between Cassels' distance functions and the convex-body
  form pinned by the roadmap. Membership in `t • B` is having gauge at most `t`, for a **closed**
  body; `mem_smul_of_gauge_lt` is the half that needs no closedness.
* `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_pos`: the minima are positive, which is where boundedness of the
  body is used, and `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_eq_zero_of_le`: they vanish above the dimension.
* `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_le_of_le` and `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_smul`: monotone in the
  index, homogeneous of degree `-1` in the body.
* `ZLattice.exists_linearIndependent_gauge_eq_successiveMinimum`: **Cassels' Lemma 1**. There is
  one linearly independent family of lattice vectors whose gauges are the successive minima. This
  is what every later proof consumes; its body form is
  `ZLattice.exists_linearIndependent_mem_smul_successiveMinimum`, which is where closedness of
  the body is used.
* `Finset.prod_pow_le_prod_range`: the regrouping that turns a bound on the product of all `d * k`
  minima into a bound on a product of `k` `d`-th powers — what Layers 5.3 and 5.4 spend to pass
  from the minima of the lattice of a `k`-dimensional `K`-subspace to `k` heights.
* `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_zero_eq`: the zeroth minimum is the least dilation containing a
  nonzero lattice point — the quantity Minkowski's convex-body theorem bounds — and
  `ZLattice.successiveMinimum_zero_le_one` is that theorem read as the case `i = 0`.

## Implementation notes

The body is carried as four separate hypotheses — convex, symmetric, with nonempty interior,
bounded — plus closedness where it is needed, rather than as one bundled structure, so that each
statement says which of them it uses. Cassels indexes the minima by a distance function `F` and
dilates `{x | F x ≤ 1}`; the convex-body form is the pinned one, and `gauge_le_iff_mem_smul` is
the translation, proved once here.

⚠ **Attainment does not need the body to be closed; only its body form does.** The family of
`ZLattice.exists_linearIndependent_gauge_eq_successiveMinimum` realizes the minima as *gauges*
for any bounded symmetric convex body with nonempty interior, and that statement is the one the
proof produces. Turning `gauge B (v j) = λ j` into `v j ∈ λ j • B` is exactly the dictionary, and
exactly what fails for an open body: for the open unit ball no lattice vector lies in `λ 0 • B`
at all, since anything inside that dilation would already have shown a smaller dilation
admissible. The two statements are therefore kept apart, and only the second carries `IsClosed B`.

⚠ **The minima are not monotone in the index without `i < finrank ℝ E`.** Above the dimension
there is no independent family at all, the set of admissible dilations is empty, and the value is
`sInf ∅ = 0`. So `Monotone (successiveMinimum L B)` is false whenever `E` is nontrivial, and a
statement of Minkowski's second theorem that ranged over all of `ℕ` would multiply by zero.

/-! ### The body and its gauge

Three facts about a symmetric convex body, none of them about lattices: it is a neighbourhood of
the origin, and its dilations are the sublevel sets of its gauge — from below always, and exactly
when the body is closed. -/

/-- A symmetric convex set with nonempty interior is a neighbourhood of `0`: the midpoint of an
interior point and its negative is an interior point. This is what makes the body absorbent, and
it is the only use of the symmetry hypothesis in the elementary theory. -/

/-- Half of the gauge dictionary, and the half that costs nothing: a point of gauge strictly less
than `t` lies in `t • B`. No closedness is needed, and this is what the existence statements below
use to exhibit an admissible dilation. -/

/-- **The gauge dictionary.** For a closed convex body with `0` in its interior, lying in the
dilation `t • B` is the same as having gauge at most `t`. This is the translation between Cassels'
distance functions and the convex-body form of the successive minima, and closedness is exactly
what it costs: for an open body the two sides differ on the boundary. -/

`finrank ℝ E` linearly independent lattice vectors whose gauges are the successive minima — not
one family for each index. This is the statement every later proof consumes.

/-- **The dependence half of Cassels' Lemma 1.** Outside the span of the first `j` members of a
family realizing the minima there is nothing of gauge below the `j`-th minimum. The point would
extend those `j` members to an independent family of `j + 1` lattice points, which bounds the
`j`-th minimum by the largest gauge in the family; the induction on `j` is what identifies that
largest gauge as the gauge of the new point, since without it the bound is only by the maximum of
the new gauge and the `(j - 1)`-st minimum, and those can be equal. -/
