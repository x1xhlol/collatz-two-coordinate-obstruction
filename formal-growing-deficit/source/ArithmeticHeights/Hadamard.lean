# The generalized Hadamard inequality

Cut the rows of a matrix into two blocks. The Gram determinant of the whole is at most the product
of the Gram determinants of the blocks:

`det (A Aᵀ) ≤ det (A₁ A₁ᵀ) · det (A₂ A₂ᵀ)`.

Through the Cauchy–Binet identity of Layer 3.4 this says that the ℓ² norm of the tuple of maximal
minors of `A` is at most the product of the ℓ² norms of the tuples of the two blocks — the
archimedean local factor of the Arakelov height of the row space is submultiplicative under cutting
the rows. Iterating down to one row per block gives **Hadamard's inequality**, that the Gram
determinant is at most the product of the squared lengths of the rows, which is the form Layer 5.5
uses to replace the row-space height by the heights of the individual rows.

This is Schmidt's §2 Lemma 2, Bombieri–Vaaler (2.6), and the Fischer inequality of
Bombieri–Gubler's Remark 2.8.9. Everything here is proved over an arbitrary ordered field: the
statements are about determinants, not about norms, and nothing analytic enters.

## Main results

* `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_fromRows_le`: the inequality itself, for the two blocks of
  `Matrix.fromRows`. `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_le_mul` is the same statement for a matrix whose
  rows are indexed by `Fin (p + q)`, cut at `p`.
* `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_le_prod`: **Hadamard's inequality**, the fully split case
  `det (A Aᵀ) ≤ ∏ᵢ ‖Aᵢ‖²`, by induction on the number of rows.
* `Matrix.abs_det_le_prod_sum_abs`: the square case, `|det M| ≤ ∏ᵢ ‖Mᵢ‖₁`, in the ℓ¹ norm rather
  than the ℓ² one so that no square root and no analysis enter. This is the form Layer 6.3 applies
  to the matrix of logarithmic embeddings of a system of units.
* `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_le_det_add`: adding a Gram matrix to a Gram matrix does not
  decrease the determinant — Minkowski's monotonicity, in the only case needed.
* `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_submatrix_le`: deleting columns does not increase the Gram
  determinant.
* `Matrix.sum_sq_norm_plucker_row_le_prod`: **Hadamard's inequality at a complex place**, the
  Hermitian form `∑ₛ ‖det Bₛ‖² ≤ ∏ᵢ ‖Bᵢ‖²`, deduced from the real one through `Matrix.realify`.

## Implementation notes

Neither Fischer's inequality nor Hadamard's is in Mathlib, and neither is the determinant
monotonicity on the positive semidefinite order that the textbook proof of Fischer runs through
(Schur complement, then `0 ≼ S ≼ G₂₂ ⇒ det S ≤ det G₂₂`). The route taken here replaces that
monotonicity by **Cauchy–Binet over a doubled column index**, which is elementary: if `V` and `W`
have orthogonal row spaces then `(V + W) (V + W)ᵀ = V Vᵀ + W Wᵀ` is the Gram matrix of the single
matrix `Matrix.fromCols V W`, whose maximal minors indexed by the columns of the first copy are
exactly those of `V`, so its sum of squares of minors is a sub-sum of the whole — and a sum of
squares only grows when terms are added. That is `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_submatrix_le`
followed by `Matrix.det_mul_transpose_self_le_det_add`.

The doubled index is `ι ⊕ₗ ι`, the lexicographic sum: the plain `ι ⊕ ι` carries Mathlib's
componentwise order, which is not linear, and `exteriorPower.plucker` needs a linear order on the
column type to say which minor a set of columns names. Only the order matters, never which order:
the determinants in the statement do not see it.

⚠ **The real inequality does not cover a complex place, and the fix is not to prove it again.**
At a complex place of a number field the archimedean local factor of the Arakelov height is a
Gram determinant `det (B Bᴴ)` with the *conjugate* transpose, and `ℂ` carries no order in which
the two-block argument above can be run. What is done here instead is to *deduce* the Hermitian
inequality from the real one, by realification: `Matrix.realify B` is the real `2m × 2n` matrix of
the same linear map read on `ℂ ≅ ℝ²`, its `2m` rows come in pairs of the same length as the row of
`B` they come from, and `Matrix.det_realify_mul_transpose` identifies its Gram determinant with
`det (B Bᴴ) ^ 2`. Real Hadamard applied to it therefore gives the complex inequality squared, and
both sides are nonnegative. The one computation is `Matrix.det_fromBlocks_neg_comm`, two unipotent
block operations bringing `fromBlocks X Y (-Y) X` to block triangular form with diagonal blocks
`X ∓ i Y`. ⚠ Realifying the *columns*
alone — the real `m × 2n` matrix `[Re B | Im B]`, whose Gram matrix is the real part of `B Bᴴ` —
does not work: it gives `det (Re (B Bᴴ)) ≤ ∏ᵢ ‖Bᵢ‖²`, and `det (B Bᴴ) ≤ det (Re (B Bᴴ))` is again
a theorem of the same depth, with no term-by-term proof. The rows have to be doubled too.

With that in hand the proof is the classical one. Project the second block orthogonally to the
first — possible exactly when `det (A₁ A₁ᵀ) ≠ 0`, and when it is `0` both sides vanish, by the
Gram criterion — which is a row operation of determinant `1`, so it changes no Gram determinant;
the Gram matrix becomes block diagonal, so its determinant factors; and the projected block has the
smaller Gram determinant by the monotonicity above.

### The square case, against the row norms

For a square matrix `det (M Mᵀ) = (det M) ^ 2`, so Hadamard's inequality bounds the determinant
itself. The form below is the **ℓ¹** one and not the familiar ℓ² one: extracting a square root of a
sum of squares would need `Real.sqrt` and with it the analysis this file does without, while the
ℓ¹ bound stays inside the ordered field, a sum of squares being already at most the square of the
sum of absolute values. Layer 6.3 wants the ℓ¹ form in any case — the rows it feeds in are vectors
of weighted logarithms whose ℓ¹ norm, not whose ℓ² norm, is twice a height.

/-- **Hadamard's inequality at a complex place.** The ℓ² norm of the tuple of maximal minors of a
complex matrix is at most the product of the ℓ² norms of its rows — the statement Layer 5.5 needs
at a complex place, where the Gram matrix is `B Bᴴ` and not `B Bᵀ`.

It is deduced from the real inequality, not proved again: the realification has twice the rows,
each of the same length as the row of `B` it comes from, and its Gram determinant is the square of
the Hermitian one. Applied to the image of a matrix over a number field under the embedding of an
infinite place, this covers the real places too, since there the embedding is real and the
conjugate transpose is the transpose. -/

/-- **Acceptance test.** For the `2 × 3` matrix whose maximal minors are `1`, `3` and `−2`, the Gram
determinant is `14`, while cutting the two rows apart gives `5 · 10 = 50`: the inequality is strict
here, and the gap `50 − 14 = 36` is the square of the inner product `6` of the two rows. -/
